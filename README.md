# Strategie für Wordle

This repository contains a project on developing and analyzing strategies for solving the game *Wordle* using probabilistic and combinatorial methods.

## Content
The project investigates how to choose optimal starting words in Wordle with the goal of minimizing the expected number of guesses. The following aspects are covered:

- Position-based letter probability heuristics
- Expected remaining candidate set (ExpRem)
- Worst-case remaining candidate set (WorstRem)
- Comparison of different starting words
- Verification and experiments using Python

## Methodology
Both theoretical analysis and computational experiments are used. Simplified models are introduced to gain intuition, followed by simulations on larger word lists to evaluate correlations between different heuristics and actual performance.

## Context
This project was created as part of the course *Zufall erforschen* at Freie Universität Berlin.
